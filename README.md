## About the Project

The project was to add functionalllity to the project in JavaScript. I used my code from the project before and added some Javascript HTML & CSS code.

### Building the navigation dynamically, not coded in the HTML file.

Use JavaScript to build a navigation bar dynamically when the document has been loaded, the nav menu comes from the app.js file and is not directly coded in the HTML file.

### Add functionality to distinguish the section in view

While navigating through the page, the section that is active in the viewport/closest to the top should be distinguished from the other sections.

### Add the functionality to scroll to sections

Clicking on a navigation item should scroll to the appropriate section of the page.

### Add active state

Add an active state to the navigation items when a section is in the viewport.


### Add a form

Add a form with submit button.
